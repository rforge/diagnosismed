\title{get.intersection Obtain the intersection of two distributions using the kernel method}
\usage{
get.intersection(ref, test, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref}{The reference standard. A column in a data frame or a vector indicating the classification by the reference test. The reference standard must be coded either as 0 (absence of the condition) or 1 (presence of the condition)}

\item{test}{The index test or test under evaluation. A column in a dataset or vector indicating the test results on a continuous scale.}

\item{...}{passing arguments to the kernel density function, other than kernel='gaussian' (default).}
}
\value{
A vector of points of intersection, ordered on their density. The tail has the highest density.
}
\description{
\code{get.intersection} Obtain the intersection of two distributions using the kernel method. Warning: This function does not check the parameters ref and test.
}
\examples{
ref=c(rep(0,500), rep(1,500))
test=c(rnorm(500,0,1), rnorm(500,1,2))
(get.intersection(ref, test)) # two intersections! Generates warning in other functions!
