<h2>Interactively draw a ROC curve with your data</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Draw a ROC curve with the user data, interactively, sliding a button, and watch
how changes at the cutoff, correlate with the changes of Sensitivity and Specificity
while building the ROC curve itself.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
interact.ROC(gold, test)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>gold</code></td>
<td>
A column in a data frame or a vector indicating the classification
by the reference test. Must be coded either as 0 - without target disease -
or 1 - with the target disease.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
A column in a data frame or a vector indicating the test under
study (index test) results. Must be numeric.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
interact.ROC is a call from roc.demo{TeachingDemo}. The difference is that
interact.ROC allow the input data be displayed as usually is in diagnostic
studies, a column with the test result and the other with the reference standard
results. Inside this function the "ask" option - which
controls the "next" button to see the next graph - is turned off - par(ask=FALSE).
Also other options must be set to this function to work fine. Type "options()".
The option ask and device.ask.default should be set as FALSE, as they usually
are by default. To turn it on again later, type par(ask=TRUE). The test must have
a rationale that higher values of the index test belong to those with the target
disease and those with lower values belong to those without the target disease.
If this is not the case, the suggestion is to transform the tests results by
multiplying it by -1 before running interact.ROC.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
interact.ROC generates two graphs in the same window: the upper graph is a ROC graph 
(Sensitivity on the vertical axis and 1-Specificity on the horizontal axis); the lower
graph is a density plot (the density on the vertical axis and the test cut-off (or threshold) 
on the horizontal axis). With a sliding button is possible to interact and see how 
the Sensitivity and Specificity changes while changing the cut-off. In the upper graph 
the cut-off is represented by the different dots and the purple line represents the distance 
to the "optimal" threshold. At the lower graph, the red line and dashes represent the density 
and the test result from those without the target condition respectively. While the blue ones 
represent those with the target condition. If the dashes are at the bottom of the lower graph 
then they are classified as without the target condition, if at the top, with the target condition.
The green vertical line represents the cut-off and changes with the sliding button. The 
cut-off itself can be seen right above the sliding button and the respective 
sensitivity and specificity at the bottom of the graph window.</p>
